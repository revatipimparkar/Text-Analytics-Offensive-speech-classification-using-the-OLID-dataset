# Offensive speech classification using the OLID dataset

This project focuses on offensive speech classification using a subset of the OLID dataset. 
Task 1 involves selecting two models for exploration, excluding pre-trained large language models. 
Task 2 requires developing and training custom classifiers based on the chosen methods, followed by evaluation. 
Task 3 investigates the effect of data size on model performance. 
Finally, Task 4 involves writing a report comparing approaches, discussing algorithm and feature selection, performance, and lessons learned.
